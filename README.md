# AI-Powered Data Analysis Chatbot (Streamlit App)


## Overview

This project is an AI-powered chatbot built with Streamlit, designed to help non-technical users gain insights from their datasets quickly and easily. By uploading a CSV or Excel file and typing in natural language prompts, users can interact with their data and uncover meaningful insightsâ€”without writing a single line of code.


## Features

- Upload CSV or Excel files

- Ask natural language questions about your data

- Get instant analysis and summary responses

- Automatically generate basic visualizations

- Powered by OpenAI and Gemini (Google AI)

- Simple and clean Streamlit interface

## How It Works

- The user uploads a dataset (CSV or Excel).


- The app reads the data using pandas.


- A question is entered (e.g., "Show the average sales by category").


- The chatbot uses OpenAI or Gemini to analyze and respond.


- Results (including charts, if needed) are displayed instantly.
